# Patriots 2017 Season Outlook

## Description

My final project for CSCI E-56 will be a New England Patriots 2017 season outlook. The aim of this endeavor is to present a breadth of information and statistics pertaining to the forthcoming season of the defending super bowl champion New England Patriots. The primary landing page will be a calendar outlining the 2017/18 Patriots game schedule. Each game will have data points such as date, time, opponent, and location. The application will provide calculations from historical data that illustrate past performance versus the current opponent. I find football stadiums interesting and will include unique data points for each venue like capacity, year built, architect, and an interesting fact or two. Another page that I intend to build will be a current active roster. The roster will link to player profiles featuring data points like: name, university attended, position, number, age, contract status, and salary. I will also include compelling data calculations like probability of being injured, and average games missed per season due to injury/suspension. The content will be laid out in a logical way that appeals to my user and will scale to accommodate devices of different size.
